# Neural-Network

A neural network implementation in Java

I have been intrigued into Neural Networks for a while now, and I decided to spend time with them again since I finally understand the mathematics behind it.

Thanks to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) and [Ryan Harris](https://www.youtube.com/user/nqramjets) for explaining the mathematics.

**Disclaimer**

I tried my best to make everything work properly, but please be aware neural networks are a highly advanced topic and there might be flaws in the repository.
