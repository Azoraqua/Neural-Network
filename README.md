# Neural-Network
A multi-layer, feedforward neural network (FNN) implementation in Java

In this branch, I decided to completely recode the project as I had lost track of where I left it behind since I stopped working on it for a few months. 
I decided to include functionalities that allow one to visualize the architecture of the Neural Network one has created. 

An example of how this looks is shown below:
